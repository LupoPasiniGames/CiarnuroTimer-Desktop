# Il Ciarnuro Round Timer - App Desktop

How to build this app:
- `git clone` this repo
- `npm install` inside the repo directory
- `npm start` to test the app (remember to update the assets with the command specified below before running the app)
- `npm run buildwin`, `npm run buildlinux` and `npm run buildmac` to build the app for the corresponding operating systems inside the `out` directory **(these three commands will automatically fetch the latest assets from the [webapp repo](https://github.com/LupoPasiniGames/CiarnuroTimer-Web))**
- `npm run update` to manually update the assets from the webapp repo

On macOS/Linux, the unzip program is required. On Windows, both .NET Framework 4.5 or higher and Powershell 3 or higher are required.
